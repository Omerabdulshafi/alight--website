<p> This is a paragraph of coding.In the past 20 years, Rwanda has transformed into a hub of tech activity, with the capital Kigali at the center. The country is investing in tech infrastructure, with the world’s most powerful multinational tech companies, including the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, setting up shop.

Yet Nyabiheke Refugee Camp in Rwanda was frustratingly cut off from the world – the nearest internet café was 15 km away, and even that was bare bones, with old computers and spotty wi-fi. There was no easy way for refugees to stay in touch with loved ones in other countries, do an online job search, or take online classes, things that might actually help them build a future.  

Gaetan, a Congolese refugee in Nyabiheke for the past 15 years, approached Alight with an ambitious idea: a computer lab for the Camp. Not just that, but one that offered IT training, preparing him and his friends for the real world in Rwanda.  </p>
